## ❓ Key Business Questions Answered  
- 📈 What are the **trends** in patient admissions and readmissions over time?  
- ⏳ How does the **average hospital stay duration** vary across years?  
- 💵 What is the **average cost per hospital visit**?  
- 🛡️ How many **procedures are covered by insurance**?  
- 🩺 What are the **most and least common procedures**, and how do demographics influence them?  

---

## 🔎 Key Insights  
- 📈 **Admission Trends:** Admissions rose sharply post-2020, likely due to external factors (e.g., pandemic). Boston remains the main hub, signaling resource optimization needs.  
- ⏳ **Length of Stay:** Decline in LOS suggests improved care/discharge practices, but very short stays (2022) raise quality concerns.  
- 🛡️ **Insurance Gaps:** Only 10 of 52 procedures are covered by insurance → most are out-of-pocket, risking patient access and satisfaction.  
- 💸 **Cost Distribution:** Average visit cost of ~$3,640 highlights affordability issues; insurance expansion could improve accessibility.  
- 🌍 **Demographics:** Most patients are from Boston & nearby cities → useful for resource allocation and service expansion.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations  
- 🤝 **Optimize Insurance Partnerships:** Expand coverage for high-demand procedures (e.g., urgent care, symptom evaluations).  
- 🏥 **Improve Short-Stay Care:** Audit 2022 short stays to ensure quality and avoid premature discharges.  
- 📊 **Predictive Modeling:** Forecast staffing and resource needs during high-admission years (2021–2022).  
- 📢 **Targeted Outreach:** Run awareness & outreach programs in underrepresented cities to improve access.  
- 💵 **Cost Review:** Analyze cost drivers of common procedures and explore reduction strategies without sacrificing care quality.
